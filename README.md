  * automatically reduces fraction to its simpliest form
  * supports coverting a integer or a float number to a fraction
  * supports the following calculations:
    * addition
    * subtraction
    * multiplication
    * division
    * reciprocal
    * negation
    
* **Matrix Class**:
  * allows user to input a n by m matrix
  * displays numbers as either integer or fraction
  * supports the following calculations of a n * m matrix:
    * addition
    * subtraction
    * matrix multiplication
    * scalar multiplication
    * transpose
  * computes the following properties of a n * m matrix:
